                  This was a login attempt to the Strongbox Admin Area, 
                  but this username does not exist in the Strongbox

                  This was a login attempt to the Strongbox Admin Area, 
                  but the password entered did not match what is stored 
                  in the Strongbox Admin password file. By chance, does
                  this username also exist where the regular member data
                  is stored?  If so, this will be problematic, so either
                  it should be removed from where it is stored with the
                  regular member data is located or a different Strongbox
                  Admin Account should be created.  For more information
                  about Strongbox Admin Users, please see the Online 
                  Owner's Manual.

                  Invalid HTTP request sent by browser, usually
                  either the result of badly configured anonymous / privacy software
                  or a poorly written cracking program.
                  "personal privacy", "anonymizer", 
or "firewall" software will only do this
when the settings are jacked up to super 
maximum.  Typically software that can do 
this will be marketed to "prevent web sites
from identifying you", so I might tell a member 
that the software did exactly what it claimed - 
it prevented us from identifying them as a 
legitimate member.
                  If it's actually a live user, the user will likely have problems with many sites
                  and should set their "firewall" software to it's
                  default settings or turn it off entirely.
