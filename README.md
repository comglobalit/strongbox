# What is Strongbox?
Strongbox is a software that protects websites from stolen passwords, password sharing, brute force attacks.

## Who should use Strongbox?
Any organization that requires a secure authentication (a secure login page).

Strongbox is designed for websites that require a secure login system, especially when there are customers that pay for access premium content like

* Online News Subscriptions (Newspapers and Magazines)
* Financial Institutions (Internet Banking).
* Paid Software Companies.
* Digital Media.
* Virtually any website with a “My account” section where it is important that only one person can get access to it.

## Strongbox Features and Benefits
* Replaces insecure login systems like Apache’s basic authentication with a strong protection.
* Provides a customizable login page with instructions for your users.
* Protects web applications and their subscribers from brute force attacks (thousands of username & password guessing by hackers from lots of locations, incredibly quickly, causing serious problems like slow/down websites or data breaches).
* Allows webmasters restrict logins by country.
* Stops account sharing: it suspends usernames if they are used from several locations (different networks or countries).
* [Secure Single Sign-On SSO](https://github.com/comglobalit/strongbox/wiki/Single-Sign-On-(SSO)-with-Strongbox-Handoff): secure links between Strongbox protected websites.
